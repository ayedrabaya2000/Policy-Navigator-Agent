# Policy‑Navigator‑Agent

**Agentic RAG system** that allows users to query and extract insights from complex government regulations, compliance policies, or public health guidelines ([github.com](https://github.com/arabaya3/Policy-Navigator-Agent--AiXplain?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## 📌 What the Agent Does

The Policy‑Navigator‑Agent provides a multi‑agent retrieval‑augmented generation workflow to let users ask natural language questions about regulatory or policy datasets. It:

- Retrieves relevant policy/regulation snippets using vector search.
- Applies specialized agents (e.g. policy checker, case‑law summarizer) to process and analyze retrieved content.
- Generates concise, grounded summaries or answers with citations.
- Supports CLI or Slack interfaces, and optionally a Streamlit UI.

## ⚙️ How to Set It Up

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayedrabaya2000/Policy-Navigator-Agent.git
   cd Policy-Navigator-Agent
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure API keys and parameters:**  
   Add your credentials (e.g. aiXplain API key) and settings in `project_config.py` or via environment variables, depending on the setup.

4. **Ingest data and build index:**  
   Run provided scripts to load datasets or public documents, generate embeddings, and build the vector index.

5. **Run the application:**
   - CLI mode:  
     ```bash
     python cli_entrypoint.py
     ```
   - Streamlit UI:  
     ```bash
     streamlit run regulation_streamlit_ui.py
     ```
   - Slack integration (test):  
     ```bash
     python slack_integration_test.py
     ```

## 📂 Dataset / Source Links

- Example dataset: **California Vehicle Code** (“VEH”) stored under `regulation_data/` ([github.com](https://github.com/arabaya3/Policy-Navigator-Agent--AiXplain?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- You can also ingest from APIs or public websites (e.g., federal regulation feeds, WHO/EPA guidelines) via the tools folder.

## 🔧 Tool Integration Steps

1. **Marketplace Tool (aiXplain API):**  
   Connect and configure authentication to query external policy APIs.

2. **Custom Python Tools:**  
   Use document parsers and handlers located under `tools/` and `regulation_tools/` to process raw content, chunk it, and embed into the vector store.

3. **CSV / SQL Tool Integration:**  
   Load structured datasets (e.g., CSV of violations or legal code) to allow querying via dedicated agents.

4. **Vector Store & Agents:**  
   The multi-agent pipeline (e.g. retriever → policy‑checker → summarizer) is orchestrated via `regulation_query_facade.py`.

## 🧪 Example Inputs/Outputs

### Example 1
**Input:**  
"What is the latest update on vehicle emissions policy?"  
**Output:**  
A summary listing the relevant code section, effective dates, compliance thresholds, and a citation to the source document.

### Example 2
**Input:**  
"Summarize case law related to Section 4000 of the Vehicle Code."  
**Output:**  
A digest of relevant legal opinions, rulings, and compliance implications, clearly summarized and attributed.

### Example 3
**Input:**  
"What are the compliance requirements for vehicle registration?"  
**Output:**  
A bullet list explaining necessary steps, legal references, coding of fees, deadlines, and a link or citation to policy excerpts.

Each output is generated through specified agents and includes reference to the tools used.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

### Feature Enhancements
- **Add more agents**, such as summarization, analytics, translation, or topic classification.
- **Improved UI/UX**, e.g. deploy a polished web interface beyond Streamlit or integrate with Slack/Microsoft Teams.
- **Integration of additional data sources**, such as federal registers, international guidelines (WHO/EPA), or regulatory feeds.
- **Implement caching or memory**, so repeated queries are faster and past conversation context is preserved.
- **Support multilingual policies**, including auto-translation and cross-jurisdiction search capabilities.

### Performance & Reliability
- Add persistent conversational memory to agents (e.g. for follow-up inquiries).
- Batch indexing and incremental updates to the vector store.
- Monitoring and logging for tool failures, API latency, and query validation.
- Support for user authentication or role-based access control for policy datasets.

## 📌 Summary

This Policy‑Navigator‑Agent offers an extensible, agent‑based RAG system for policy document querying, using vector search and modular tools. Setup is straightforward, and it includes CLI, UI, and Slack interfaces. Future improvements span agent breadth, UI polish, data coverage, memory/caching, and multi-language support.
